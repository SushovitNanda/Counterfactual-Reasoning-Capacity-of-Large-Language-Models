# Counterfactual-Reasoning-Capacity-of-Large-Language-Models
This project is done in my Summer Internship 2024 Under Dr. Shreya Ghosh, Indian Institute of Technology Bhubaneshwar.
There are several kinds of reasoning that humans are capable of. One such reasining is counterfactual reasoning which is also deemed as the most complex type of reasoning.
This project aims to work with several META LLAMA Large Language Models to assess their text-generation pipeline for counterfactual reasoning question-answering.
