# Counterfactual-Reasoning-Capacity-of-Large-Language-Models
This project is done in my 2024 Summer Internship under Dr. Shreya Ghosh, Indian Institute of Technology Bhubaneshwar.
There are several kinds of reasoning that humans are capable of. One such reasining is counterfactual reasoning which is also deemed as the most complex type of reasoning.
This project aims to work with several META LLAMA Large Language Models to assess their text-generation pipeline for counterfactual reasoning question-answering. 
In this repositiory I will include the following - The dataset used for my project, several ipynb files from google colab as a higher GPU such as the T4 GPU provided by Google Colab for free will be required to run the LLMs, and my project report.
